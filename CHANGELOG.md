# V1.0 Permutations

## V1.0.3
* Pawn shop has a small random stock of items and resources most are with 90%, 75%, 40%, or 25% chance
* Will now sell informational items (Survey Maps, Cache Locations, Trigger Books). I hope to sell mission board quest triggers too eventually.
* Cut credits in half 400k seems too much probably should around 100k I probably could make it random. Thoughts? 

## V1.0.2
* Updated splash screen image from domi29

## V1.0.1
* No more loose files everything is one BA2 now which should make manual installs way easier. Overriding the screen for the Crimson Fleet Faction terminal until CK2 or find a way to make a custom model.  

## V1.0.0
* Initial Release
