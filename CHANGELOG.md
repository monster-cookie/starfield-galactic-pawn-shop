# V1.0 Permutations

## V1.0.4
* Use global value LegalPawnShop (XX000808) to control selling/stocking of contraband items. Use "FindForm LegalPawnShop" to get the correct form ID for your load order, then use "set XX000808 to 1" fixing XX to your index value, finally use "help LegalPawnShop" to verify it's setting. Use the outpost modify mode to remove the old terminal first or you will not be able to deploy a new one. They are mutually exclusive. 

## V1.0.3
* Pawn shop has a small random stock of items and resources most are with 90%, 75%, 40%, or 25% chance
* Will now sell informational items (Survey Maps, Cache Locations, Trigger Books). I hope to sell mission board quest triggers too eventually.
* Cut credits in half 400k seems too much probably should around 100k I probably could make it random. Thoughts? 

## V1.0.2
* Updated splash screen image from domi29

## V1.0.1
* No more loose files everything is one BA2 now which should make manual installs way easier. Overriding the screen for the Crimson Fleet Faction terminal until CK2 or find a way to make a custom model.  

## V1.0.0
* Initial Release
